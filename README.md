<h1 align="center">Pytorch GPU Template</h1>

<p align="center">Start a new pytorch project in a vscode dev container with cuda enabled</p>

## Purpose

To avoid compatibility issues with other projects, and make it easier to start a new gpu project, I've found its easier to begin with a template that has everything configured already. This template has the minimum amount of configuration I usually need to get a project up and running.

### Installed Versions

- Pytorch 1.10
- Cuda 11.3
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Setup

1. Install the dev container extension from the [vscode marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) ** Requires docker to be installed **
2. Launch the dev container

While the dev container is building, behind the scenes it will install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file.

Happy building! üôÇÔ∏è
